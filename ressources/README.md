* ISCRAM 2019 - Applying accimap to a DDOS attack on a West-European Telecom Operator.pdf

	This is the article I wrote describing the post mortem for a DDOS attack on a telecom operator. The file contains some 
	theoretical background for the research and the methodology by which we found a great number of recommendations.
	
* Recommendations anonymized.xlsx

	This file contains the recommendations we found in our research. They have been anonymmized to maintain confidentiality
	
* Branford-Guidelines for AcciMap Analysis.pdf

	A chapter in a book describing the approach we used
	
If yuou first read the article, you will acquire some information about the context of the research. The idea is that by doing
several workshops, we worked out all the steps that lead to a service outage that started with a DDOS attack. The different
steps ('causal links') are not described in the article. They were used to formulate the recommendations in the excel file.

I hope this will give you enough background to start exploring the data.
